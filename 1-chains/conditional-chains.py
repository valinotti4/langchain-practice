# Feedback examples
# Good: This refurbished Alexa is perfect! Not a scratch on it! Great sound. Iâ€™m glad I purchased it.
# Negative: I received my order with the back area cracked and missing the charging cable. The delivery was so poor, I was extremely upset and ended up throwing the Echo in the garbage. This has been a frustrating and upsetting experience. I expected much better, and this has been a complete letdown. Would not recommend to buy the echo
# Neutral: The product is OK. Work as expected but nothing exceptional
